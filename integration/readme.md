TODO(alex) [mid] 2021-07-15: Write about the changes:
- Split project into bin and lib for test purposes;
- Dive deeper on testing:
    - Explain tests structure (briefly);
    - Talk a bit about the macro;
    - Mention single-threaded only rule for tests;
    - `test::read_*` functions as a way to extract data;
    - If you get 404, check that every required service was added to the test;
